                <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                <p>
                    When a user wants to visit a webpage they input the <strong>Fully Qualified Domain Name
                        (FQDN)</strong> into
                    their browser which resolves the IP address using a <strong>Domain Name System (DNS)</strong>
                    server.
                    The user then connects to the server using the IP address which host the designated homepage. The
                    user's
                    browser
                    loads the designated homepage at the root url
                    which is typically named <strong>index</strong> with some suffix such as .html, .js, etc. Static
                    content
                    homepages such as this one typically end
                    in .html (hypertext mark up languages) whereas dynmaclly generated homepages end in .js (javascript)
                    or
                    other
                    suffixs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A users Web Dev/Inspector Networks tab output screen displays the <strong>request</strong> and
                    <response>
                        response</response> headers which contain valuable information such as
                    stutus code, type, url, last time modified, and method. The reponse body contains the actual data
                    such as
                    the
                    index.html document. If the file is viewed from the web server the url will
                    contain a FQDN such as https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~amidonk whereas if it viewed from a local
                    machine
                    the
                    url will be displayed in the following format
                    file:///users/kevin/Desktop/CS%290/M1/a1-amidonk/index.html.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <strong>favicon.ico</strong> file has a status of 200 ok because it found on the server however
                    the
                    main.css
                    and main.js have a 404 error meaning the files were not found because they were not found.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A url can consist of a <strong>scheme</strong>, <strong>subdomain</strong>, <strong>host
                        domain</strong> and
                    <strong>resources</strong>. The scheme is the protocol such as http and https. The subdomain is
                    an optional prefix to the domain name such as www. The host domain is the main address of the
                    website which
                    includes a domain name and a <strong>Top Level Domain (TLD)</strong>. Resources provides the
                    specific location where a requested item can be found.
